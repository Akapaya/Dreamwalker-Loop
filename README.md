# Unity Project: Dreamwalker-Loop (Practice Project)

Welcome to my Unity repository, where I share my project developed as part of my digital games practices to improve my analysis and development of systems.

## Project description

### Dreamwalker-Loop
The idea for this project came from challenging myself and practicing developing a system that is extensible and easy to maintain. I took advantage of the success of anomaly games to develop a game with a more professional system.

However, even though it was just a project for portfolio and training, I decided to try to do something more coherent, because as it is kind of a new genre, many don't care about the history or even try to explain why the anomalies are happening, so I deciding to carry out an event that involves me a lot that fits very well into this idea of loop and anomalies.
